						When I was a backpacker, it was unknown <br>
						whether I had a visa, vaccine, or tour route to go to a country <br>
						with little information far from Japan.<br>
						I listened to various people and browsed blogs,<br>
						but I was still very anxious.<br>
						In addition, there was little information on SNS and books,<br>
						but I was worried about what other spots <br>
						and interesting places were there.<br>
						So let's share the countries and places you have visited.<br>
