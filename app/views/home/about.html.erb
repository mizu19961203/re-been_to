					When I was a backpacker, it was unknown <br>
					whether I had a visa, vaccine, or tour route to go places <br>
					with little information far from Japan.<br>
					I listened to various people and browsed blogs,<br>
					but I was still very anxious.<br>
					In addition, there was little information on SNS and books,<br>
					but I was worried about what other spots <br>
					and interesting places were there.<br>
					Let's share the countries and places you have visited.<br>
